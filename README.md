# Gradient_Boosting_ML
Quick guide to XGBoost for model fitting

*Gradient boosting* is a technique that iteratively adds models to an ensemble through cycles.

### Steps
1. For each observation in the dataset, we produce predictions using the current ensemble. We combine the forecasts from each model in the ensemble to arrive at a prediction.
2.Calcuate loss function
3. Use loss function to fit the model
4. Add the model to ensemble
 
 All the steps have been shown in our model created.
